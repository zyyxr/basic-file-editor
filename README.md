# basic-file-editor

The purpose of this program is to be able to perform file/line operations on files that are within the same directory as the program. This was done in under a month whilst trying to learn C from scratch, so I appreciate that there are multiple regions of the code that are highly inefficient but nonetheless, it's sufficient enough to me that I was able to create something like this with the time I had!

**Downloading and program info:**
* To run the program, the ``Main Program.c`` file alongside the remaining header (``.h``) files need to be downloaded - if you would like to run these operations on files of a certain directory, store these files within that same directory.
* The file operations this program has to offer consist of:
    * ``createFile``
    * ``copyFile``
    * ``showFile``
    * ``deleteFile``
    * ``searchFile``
* The line operations consist of:
    * ``appendLine``
    * ``showLine``
    * ``deleteLine``
    * ``insertLine``
    * ``showLines``
    * ``editLine``
